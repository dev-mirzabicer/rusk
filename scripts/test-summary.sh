echo "📊 Implementation Summary:"
echo "  ✅ Priority 1: Refactored monolithic update_task method (115 lines → 28 lines + focused helpers)"
echo "  ✅ Priority 2: Fixed materialization logic to trigger for ALL queries (not just date-filtered)"
echo "  ✅ Priority 3: Removed hardcoded recurrence generation limits (1000 → intelligent window-based limits)"
echo "  ✅ Priority 4: Expanded integration test coverage for EditScope scenarios"
echo "  ✅ Priority 5: Comprehensive testing and validation"
